Customer Portfolio Management (CPM) is a private platform I built for Thales MFI. An asset manager registers a customer's exchange API keys, MT5 broker accounts, and wallet addresses. CPM then shows that customer's balances, positions, orders, and risk across every venue on one page.

Exchange scanners sync spot, futures, and options holdings from Binance, Bybit, Deribit, Coinbase, Kraken, KuCoin, and other venues. MT5 covers traditional brokers. Chain scanners read wallets on Bitcoin, EVM chains, Solana, Polkadot, Sui, TON, Tron, XRP, and more. Scheduled jobs keep prices and balances current, and Socket.IO pushes each change to the open dashboard. Reports cover portfolio snapshots, asset history, transaction flow, and CSV export. A Telegram bot handles login and notifications.

The frontend is Nuxt. The API is NestJS on Bun, with PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB behind it. The source is private. The company site is the public face.
